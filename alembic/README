## Project beliefs

- Puzzles are important and your archive should be important too; We are good stewards for your puzzles in the longterm
- Data storage is just files. It's on disk, it's easy to find a specific puzzle and share it (or backup your whole archive)
- Your archive integrates with other apps so that it's comfortable to solve puzzles wherever you solve puzzles
- Complexity should be isolated and it's ok to have multiple processes to isolate that complexity (agents, importers, and the web interface are different concerns)
- This project should prioritize self-hosting and not be built for web-scale or production use
- Booting this project should be easy as `docker run` and not require external dependencies
